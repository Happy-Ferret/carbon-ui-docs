# Carbon UI Docs
======

Run `npm run gen:watch` to generate the docs (from [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen)) and build the examples.

Run `npm start` to start the React Native packager, and `npm run start:web` to start the webpack dev server (will be hosted at `localhost:8080`).

Run `npm run build:web` to webpack the source.

Run `npm run pushToASO` to push the built source up to A Small Orange (if you have the ssh key). Make sure you `git commit` and `git push` your changes first.
